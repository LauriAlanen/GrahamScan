# Graham Scan Algorithm for Convex Hull Calculation

This project implements the Graham Scan algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of 2D points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points.
- Implementation based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan

The program reads a list of coordinates from a file, computes the convex hull, prints the results, and optionally visualizes the points and the hull.

---

## Features

- Reads 2D coordinates from a file (`graham.txt`).
- Computes the convex hull using the Graham Scan algorithm.
- Displays the results in the console.
- Visualizes the points and the convex hull using Matplotlib (optional).

## Prerequisites
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

To install Matplotlib, run:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
Run Graham Scan

```bash
python graham_scan.py
```
